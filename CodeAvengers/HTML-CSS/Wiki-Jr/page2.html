<h1>Skylanders Superchargers</h1>
<h2>Skylanders Superchargers Characters</h2>
<p>Some of the Skylanders available for play include Spyro the Dragon and Cynder, both of which were included in The Legend of Spyro series. Skylanders is otherwise unrelated to the two previous Spyro series. However, Spyro has the same powers as the first games, losing his Legend of Spyro powers.</p>
<h2>Skylanders Superchargers Vehicles</h2>
<p>So far, the only character to have a new figure developed for every game has been Gill Grunt. In his first four iterations, he was a ranged character with a harpoon gun and water blaster (acting like a flame-thrower type weapon), and in Skylanders: SuperChargers he was reimagined as a melee fighter using a Trident.</p>
